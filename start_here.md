# Preliminaries

* VirtualBox
* A virtual machine running Linux (I'm using Lubuntu, but any flavor should work), with minimum requirements:
  * 4GB RAM
  * 1 CPU
  * 64 MB video RAM
  * 40 GB virtual storage

# Choices

I made some choices for working on this demo:
* Virtualization -- to better control the hardware involved
* Native installation -- to see just how difficult this could get (and containers can present their own integration and configuration difficulties)
* Linux -- it's the best operating system an IT mechanic can get (and you can't beat the price)
* Open-source software -- to show what's possible at zero cost and maximum transparency
* Use the latest LTS version of software to get out of frequent feature update headaches

**But we should never be too tied to our tools of choice.**
