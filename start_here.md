# Why this setup?

* Proof-of-concept for pipeline tools
* All the tools are free
* But... make sure the licensing is appropriate to your use case (e.g. "community" editions of commercial software)

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

# Preliminaries

* VirtualBox
* A virtual machine running Linux (I'm using Lubuntu, but any flavor should work), with minimum requirements:
  * 4GB RAM
  * 1 CPU
  * 64 MB video RAM
  * 40 GB virtual storage

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

# Choices

I made some choices for working on this demo:
* **Virtualization** -- to better control the hardware involved
* **Native installation** -- to see just how difficult this could get (and containers can present their own integration and configuration difficulties)
* **Locally installed solutions** -- still leery about sending source code to the cloud
* **Linux** -- it's the best operating system an IT mechanic can get (and you can't beat the price)
* **Open-source software** -- to show what's possible at zero cost and maximum transparency
* **Up-to-date** -- Use the latest LTS version of software to get out of frequent feature update headaches

**But we should never be too tied to our weapons of choice.**
